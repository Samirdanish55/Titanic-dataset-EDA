# Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis  
### A Practical Project on Data Exploration using Python

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the famous **Titanic dataset** to uncover meaningful insights about passenger survival.  
Using Python and data analysis libraries, the project explores how factors such as **gender, passenger class, age, family size, and embarkation port** influenced survival outcomes during the Titanic disaster.

This project was created as part of **academic learning, internship preparation, and data science skill development**.

- Understand the structure and features of the Titanic dataset  
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Analyze survival trends across different passenger attributes  
- Visualize patterns using graphs and plots  
- Build a strong foundation in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 🔹 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Loading & Understanding
- Loaded the Titanic dataset  
- Inspected dataset shape, columns, and data types  
- Reviewed summary statistics  

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Identified and handled missing values  
- Prepared clean data for analysis  

### 3️⃣ Feature Engineering
- Created **Family Size** and **Family Type** features  
- Enhanced dataset for better insight extraction  

### 4️⃣ Categorical Encoding
- Converted categorical variables into numerical format using **One-Hot Encoding**  
- Encoded features such as passenger class, sex, embarkation port, and family type  

### 5️⃣ Data Visualization
- Count plots for survival distribution  
- Bar plots for gender-wise and class-wise survival  
- Box plots for age and fare analysis  

### 6️⃣ Survival Analysis
- Gender-based survival comparison  
- Passenger class impact on survival  
- Age group influence on survival  
- Family size survival trends  
- Embarkation port-based analysis

## 📊 Results & Insights

- Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate than males  
- Passengers travelling in **Pclass 3** experienced the highest mortality  
- Passengers embarking from port **C** showed better survival chances  
- The **20–40 age group** had a higher chance of not surviving  
- Passengers with **small families** survived more compared to those travelling alone or in large families
